# FileUploaderTask

## Title - Sign In using Google and file uploader

* You need to create a web page and implement sign-in using Google authentication. 
* After login, users should be able to upload any kind of file in a local directory of a web server.
* Also, you'll need to list all the files uploaded using the same uploader. 
* Clicking on a file should download that file.
* You can use any language of your choice to create this however we prefer you use react and node.js.
* The uploaded content is critical and important, so keep security in mind.
